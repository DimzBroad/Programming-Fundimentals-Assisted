EPIC - CREATE RANDOM PASSWORD GENERATOR...

Summary...
For the assisted project I decided to create a simple randomized password generator. I wanted it do be able to do a few things.

I wanted the user to be able to select a specific password character length, I wanted the user to able have the choice to include or exclude certain character types. 

    • User wants to generate a random password.
        [•] Create a simple program that generates a basic password containing only upper and lower case characters.
        [•] Create variables and a function which generates a random password one event i.e. when a button is clicked. 
            
    • User wants to generate a random password with a specified character length.
        [•] Create a number input allowing the user to select their password character length.
            
    • User wants to generate a stronger password, including both characters and numbers.
        [•] Create CHECKBOX. If the checkbox is checked, the generated password will include both characters and numbers.  
        
    • User wants to generate a stronger password, including both characters and symbols.
        [•] Create CHECKBOX. If the checkbox is checked, the generated password will include both characters and numbers.  
        
    • User wants to generate an even stronger password, including both characters and symbols and numbers.
        [•] Create CHECKBOX. If the checkbox is checked, the generated password will include both characters and numbers.
