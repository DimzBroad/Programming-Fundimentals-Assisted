Assisted Programming Fundimentals Assignment Dimitris Broad


Explanation assisted: For the purpose of the assisted assignment, i decided to create a simple password generator. 
The goal was to give the user an option of generating a random password with a specific character length.

Explanation: unassisted: The goal for the unassisted assignment was to add on to the password generator. 
I wanted to provide the user with extra character options to include into the generation of their password. 

EPIC - create a simple password generator: 

• User wants to generate a random password (assisted)...
    [•] Create a simple program that generates a basic password containing only lower case characters.
    [•] Create variables and a function which generates a random password one event i.e. when a button is clicked. 
    
• User wants to generate a random password with a specified character length 
    [•] Create a number input allowing the user to select their password character length.   
        
• User wants to generate a stronger password, including both characters and numbers (unassisted)....
    [•] Create CHECKBOX. If the checkbox is checked, the generated password will include both upper and lowercase characters.  
    
• User wants to generate a stronger password, including both characters and symbols.
    [•] Create CHECKBOX. If the checkbox is checked, the generated password will include both characters and numbers.  
    
• User wants to generate an even stronger password, including both characters and symbols and numbers.
    [•] Create CHECKBOX. If the checkbox is checked, the generated password will include both characters and numbers.
